                    <p><span className='text-success'>JWT </span> stands for Json Web Token. It is the most popular user authorization technique for web applications nowadays, mostly micro web services.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>The user sends a request to the server,then the server sends the jwt token to the user. Inside this jwt token, the server includes header, payload and signature.
                        <br />
Inside the header, the server is written in which algorithm is used in this jwt token.
<br />
Payload is the user information and signature is the secret key.
By the secret key, the server ensures that this is the right user.
<br />
In this case, the server does not keep any data from the user. All the data will be sent from the server to the user and the user keeps this jwt token in browser cookies or others.</p>
